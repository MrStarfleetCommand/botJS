NOT YET READY FOR USE

botJS is a bot editing tool for wikis running on MediaWiki. The tool itself is written in JavaScript and can be used through an HTML user interface.

NOTE: This project is currently on hold since I can't find a way to remotely login, submit edits, etc. (api.php doesn't allow those sorts of requests from foreign domains).
